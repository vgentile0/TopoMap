# TopoMap
**This project aims to develop software that autonomously analyzes network topology using various strategies to identify hosts, routers, and subnets. The results will be presented through a graphical interface that visually displays the network as a graph**

Made by Monica Avella, Ivan Belvito, Vincenzo Gentile, Antonio Favuzzi

- As of now, this tool doesn't have GUI and class RouteAnalyzer is still not implemented. Other classes work as expected.
