# TopoMap

Simple Network Topology Mapper

*This project aims to develop software that autonomously analyzes network topology using various strategies to identify hosts, routers, and subnets. The results will be presented through a graphical interface that visually displays the network as a graph*

Made by Monica Avella, Ivan Belvito, Vincenzo Gentile, Antonio Favuzzi

- The graph will be saved in /Documents/TopoMap/risultati_scansioni
